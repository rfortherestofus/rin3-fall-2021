# Three Tips

---

## Do all websites give download links?

<a href='https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S2801&g=0100000US%240500000&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S2801&hidePreview=true'><center><img src='images/download-table.png' width='600px'/></center></a>

---

## Do all websites give download links?

- Sometimes you can find an R package for accessing data

  - [{tidycensus}](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) contains data from the US Census
  
  - [{WDI}](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/WDI/) contains data from the World Bank
  
- You might be able to scrape the webpage or use an API (Charlie's putting together a discussion thread on this).

## Working with `tabyl` objects

When you use `tabyl()` it creates a special `data.frame` which are manipulated with the `adorn_*()` functions.

**But** sometimes you need to turn it back into a tibble:

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  tabyl(marital) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  untabyl()
```

## Creating beautiful tables in RMarkdown

There are **many** packages for creating beautiful tables in RMarkdown.

- Create very simple tables with `knitr::kable()`

- [Create fancy static tables with `{gt}`](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/)

- Create fancy interactive tables with [{reactable}](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/womens-world-cup/womens-world-cup.html) or [{DT}](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/extensions.html#buttons)
