# What else can RMarkdown do?

---

# RMarkdown can do a lot...

.pull-left[
We've seen that you can make the following:

- HTML reports

- PDF reports

- Word reports

... but there's a lot more.
]

--

.pull-right[

- Beautiful books with `bookdown`

- Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

- Beautiful slides with `xaringan`

- Programmatically generated reports

- Dashboards (... and even shiny apps!)

- Websites all in RMarkdown!

# Beautiful books with `bookdown`

.pull-left[
The `bookdown` package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

# Beautiful books with `bookdown`

.pull-left[
The `bookdown` package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

I also wrote a discussion thread about how [`bookdown` is necessary to add internal cross-referencing to your documents](https://rfortherestofus.com/groups/r-in-3-months-fall-2021/forum/discussion/bibliographies-and-cross-referencing-in-rmarkdown/).

# Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

.pull-left[
The `pagedown` package is designed to radically simplify designing documents you need to print.

Instead of learning `LaTeX` you can use HTML and CSS!

# `pagedreport`

.pull-left[
R for the Rest of Us has created a package called [`pagedreport`](https://pagedreport.rfortherestofus.com/) that adds several templates to {pagedown.}

# Beautiful slides with `xaringan`

These lecture slides were written with `xaringan`.

They look really nice, plus they prevent you from writing too much on each slide.

--

```{r, eval=TRUE, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat(stringi::stri_rand_lipsum(2))
```

---

# Parameterized reports

Use [parametrized RMarkdown reporting](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) to make a separate report for each region

```{yaml}
---
params:
  state: "Alaska"
title: "`r params$state` Report"
---
  
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
qualitative_data %>% 
  filter(state == params$state)
```

# Websites created all in RMarkdown! <br><br>A `distill` demo

---

# `distill` for websites (and blogs)

Using `distill` is the easiest way to create a fully functioning data blog with RMarkdown.

We'll put together a thorough discussion thread about this.

---


# Final Week

Charlie will host her office hours as usual at 12pm Wednesday.

In the live session we'll cover:

- What resources to use next.

- How to ask reproducible questions with {reprex}

- Highlighted assignment submissions from **you folks**!

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Final assignment:<br>Show us what you can do!

---

### Final assignment

We'd love to understand how R in 3 Months is going to help you with your work/datasets.

--

We'd like you to record a 5 minute video showing something you can now do with your real data/project.

--

> [Loom.com](https://www.loom.com/pricing) has a free tier that will allow you to record and share 5 minute videos.

There's a form to fill on [Week 13's assignment submission page](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/r-in-3-months-fall-2021/lessons/r-in-3-months-fall-2021-final-project-assignment/).

# Feedback

We love doing R in 3 Months and want to continually improve it.

There are two ways we want to collect feedback:

--

1. Open-ended discussion of what went well, what can be improved, etc. David will start it out. 

--

2. Post-survey that shows your skill now (we'll compare this to what you told us in the pre-survey)


---

## Post-Survey

rfor.us/rin3-fall21-feedback

# Next Week

--

- No course assignments

--

- Record a <5 minutes video showing what you've learned

--

- Please provide any feedback to reflection thread David will create

--

- Please complete post-survey [rfor.us/rin3-fall21-feedback](https://rfor.us/rin3-fall21-feedback)

--

- Charlie's office hours are still on

- The live session will give you pointers of where to go next
