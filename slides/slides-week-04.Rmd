# Four Tips

---

## Updating columns

There's a base R way of doing things

```{r}
your_data$question_12 <- as.numeric(your_data$question_12)
```

... and there's the tidyverse way of doing things

```{r}
your_data <- your_data %>% 
  mutate(question_12 = as.numeric(question_12))
```

## coord_flip() is no longer necessary

In [March 2020 ggplot2 3.0 was released](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/ggplot2-3-3-0/) and removed the need to use `coord_flip()`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gss_cat %>% 
  count(marital) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = marital,
             y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```


---

# "Removed XX rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin)"

---

```{r eval = TRUE, message=TRUE, warning = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm,
           y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Save Source, not Workspace

Why do we not want to reload our data when we start RStudio?
