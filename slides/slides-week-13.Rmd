# What else can RMarkdown do?

---

# RMarkdown can do a lot...

.pull-left[
We've seen that you can make the following:

- HTML reports

- PDF reports

- Word reports

... but there's a lot more.
]

--

.pull-right[

- Beautiful books with {bookdown}

- Beautiful reports with {pagedown}

- Beautiful slides with {xaringan}

- Friendly Readme pages for GitHub repos

- Programmatically generated reports

- Data blogs written all in RMarkdown!

- Dashboards (... and even shiny apps!)

# Beautiful books with {bookdown}

.pull-left[
The {bookdown} package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

# Beautiful books with {bookdown}

.pull-left[
The {bookdown} package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

I also wrote a discussion thread about how [{bookdown} is necessary to add internal cross-referencing to your documents](https://rfortherestofus.com/groups/r-in-3-months-fall-2021/forum/discussion/bibliographies-and-cross-referencing-in-rmarkdown/).

# Beautiful reports with {pagedown}

.pull-left[
The {pagedown} package is designed to radically simplify designing documents you need to print.

Instead of learning `LaTeX` you can use HTML and CSS!

# {pagedreport}

.pull-left[
R for the Rest of Us has created a package called [{pagedreport}](https://pagedreport.rfortherestofus.com/) that adds several templates to {pagedown.}

# Beautiful slides with {xaringan}

These lecture slides were written with {xaringan}.

They look really nice, plus they prevent you from writing too much on each slide.

--

```{r, eval=TRUE, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat(stringi::stri_rand_lipsum(2))
```

---

## Friendly Readme files for GitHub repos

README.md files make GitHub repos much more reader friendly.

These can be created with RMarkdown as follows

```{yaml}
---
title: "R in 3 Months Lecture Slides"
output: github_document
---
```

... which you can see on [the repo for these slides](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-fall-2021).

# Programmatically generated reports

There are several different ways that RMarkdown reports can be made more *programmatic*:

1. Split a long, complex report into separate RMarkdown documents.

```{yaml}
complex-report/ - main-report.Rmd
                - state-overview.Rmd
                - interview-analysis.Rmd
                - quantiative-analysis.Rmd
```

We used that technique when writing the [2020 Census state-by-state reports for the FCCP](https://funderscommittee.org/2020censusstatereports/).

# Programmatically generated reports

There are several different ways that RMarkdown reports can be made more *programmatic*:

1. Split a long, complex report into separate RMarkdown documents.

1. Use [parametrized RMarkdown reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) to make a separate report for each region

```{yaml}
---
params:
  state: "Alaska"
title: "`r params$state` Report"
---
```
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
qualitative_data %>% 
  filter(state == params$state)
```
````

# Programmatically generated reports

1. Split a long, complex report into separate RMarkdown documents.

1. Use [parametrized RMarkdown reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) to make a separate report for each region

3. Generate many charts and programmatically insert these into your document.

```{r}
src <- map(levels(unique(gapminder$continent)), function(continent)
  knit_expand(text = c(
    "```{r gg-gapminder-{{tolower(continent)}}-scatter, fig.cap='Scatter plot for {{continent}}'}",
    "knitr::include_graphics('gapminder_{{tolower(continent)}}_scatter.png')",
    "```"
  )))
```

I'd like to write a blogpost about this for R for the Rest of Us.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Data blogs written all in RMarkdown! <br><br>A {distill} demo

---

# {distill} for websites (and blogs)

Using {distill} is the easiest way to create a fully functioning data blog with RMArkdown.

We'll put together a thorough discussion thread about this.

# Final assignment:<br>Show us what you can do!

### Final assignment

We'd love to understand how R in 3 Months is going to help you with your work/datasets.

--

We'd like you to record a 5 minute video showing something you can now do with your real data/project.

--

> [Loom.com](https://www.loom.com/pricing) has a free tier that will allow you to record and share 5 minute videos.

There's a form to fill on [Week 13's assignment submission page](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/r-in-3-months-fall-2021/lessons/r-in-3-months-fall-2021-week-12-project-assignment/).

In the live session we'll cover:

- What resources to use next.

- How to ask reproducible questions with {reprex}

- Highlighted assignment submissions from **you folks**!
